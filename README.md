> Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
Note: the project pathname is different from the staging server, localhost, and production server.
Make appropriate changes in nuxt.config.js file and also ~/components/Jumbo.vue file where the link takes you back to the main file. Note there do not write /index.html or else the where we're working modal won't work.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
